    "Samplers let you train models on images in special ways. That sounds a bit abstract, but it can be clearly stated that you will use samplers whenever you are training on anything other than the entire image. The most common uses of samplers are for training on slices, patches, or blocks of full images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training on parts of images is actually quite common in medical imaging AI tasks, primarily because 3D medical images are quite large in size and usually only contain a lot of irrelevant space in the image. The process of correctly and efficiently sampling these parts of images is often a struggle to do manually, which is why nitrain aims to make this process simple!\n",
