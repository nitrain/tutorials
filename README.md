# Tutorials and examples for nitrain

This repo contains documentation that goes in-depth on each aspect of the nitrain framework, as well as complete examples of training medical imaging AI models using nitrain. All tutorials are available here via reproducible notebooks, but you can also browse them online at [nitrain.dev/docs](https://nitrain.dev/docs) in rendered format.

If you are looking to follow a guided plan that teaches you everything you need to know about training medical imaging AI models using nitrain, then we recommend also checking out the book [Becoming a medical imaging AI expert with Python](https://book.nitrain.dev).

## Segmentation

This folders contains complete notebooks that show you how to train medical image segmentation models using nitrain. All notebooks should be completely reproducible, including accessing the original datasets. It includes the following examples:

- [Liver tumor segmentation from CT images](https://github.com/nitrain/tutorials/blob/main/segmentation/Liver-tumor-segmentation.ipynb)

## Regression

This folders contains complete notebooks that show you how to train medical image segmentation models using nitrain. All notebooks should be completely reproducible, including accessing the original datasets. It includes the following examples:

- [Predicting age from T1 brain images](https://github.com/nitrain/tutorials/blob/main/regression/T1-brain-age-with-keras.ipynb)

## Documentation

This folder contains all of the tutorials for nitrain. Each tutorial will teach you how to certain classes or functions in the nitrain framework. These tutorials can be followed independently, so feel free to use them to sharpen your knowledge in a particular area.

## Contributing

Please submit an issue if you have an example to contribute or want to request a specific tutorial, model, or dataset. We welcome all contributions and requests.
