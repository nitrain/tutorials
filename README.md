# Tutorials and examples for nitrain

This repository contains full end-to-end tutorials and examples for the nitrain framework for medical imaging AI. They cover different types of imaging types (2D, 3D), tasks (classification, segmentation, regression), and frameworks (keras, pytorch). 

If you are looking to learn more about training medical imaging AI models in general, then check out the book [Becoming a medical imaging AI expert with Python](https://book.nitrain.dev). An overview of the various tutorials available here is presented below.
